	<p style="text-indent: 40px">When I first discovered computer programming in college, I was amazed at how fast time would pass when I sat down to work on a project. I am never one to forget to sleep, eat, or push through such functions, yet would consistently find myself working late and looking up from my computer to realize I had become incredibly hungry or tired without realizing it. While I can’t claim to have any great programming skill, I did find myself in a similar mental state to that of when I was playing soccer or running, things I had spent a lot of time practicing and was able to zone out while doing. This activity, and the subsequent amount of time I spent in front of a screen, was entirely new. Last week, when I looked at flow state in relation to running and runners high, one of the key aspects to its achievement was a high degree of skill. This week, I will explore flow state as it relates to computers and other electronic devices, both skilled and unskilled. </font></font></h1></p>

<font face="Time new roman" ><font size="4" color="black">
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Elements of flow during social media use are a fairly common personal experience. I’ve spent many minutes or hours scrolling mindlessly through friends’ stories, news feeds, and other informational channels, then exit out of the application only to reopen it without thinking five minutes later. Reconnecting with friends, looking at the daily activities of others, and engaging with groups or events are all reasons I personally engage in these apps, and were all cited as reasons for Facebook and social network use4. While these motives are very different from marathon running or intense skilled activity, Mauri et. al. found some similarities between psychophysiological ‘symptoms’ of flow state and those of Facebook users1. They define a more focused type of flow, called ‘core flow’, and find physical signs in users, such as level of respiration, heart-rate, and pupil dilation, which corresponded with levels of valence and arousal near to this experience. Diminishment of flow from brain activation to certain physiological markers may be too reductionist, and it would be important to compare this data to general website usage. </br>It is interesting, however, that we have an actual physical response similar to that of the flow state which is activated by simply sitting and using social media or computers. One factor which may tie into this is the sense of actually being within an electronic environment (known as ‘telepresence’), shown to be important for the flow experience and the sense of timelessness when using an application or website3. <br>What is especially interesting the direct element of control involved in these flow experiences, since companies and designers are able to manipulate the digital environment in a way that isn’t possible in the real world3. This ability to manipulate the depth of ‘presence’ may be the key to more deeply understanding the flow state outside of the digital environment as well. Perhaps, while a certain skill level and degree of difficulty are necessary components to flow in the <q>real world<q>, designers of these sites are able to bypass these requirements with their design in a way that makes this state more accessible. </br>Another reason for the attachment to social media is the negative affect social media users expect when they stop engaging with their media networks, as they have largely neglected these other spaces, and thus are reinforced in their belief that social networks are their only source of connection and positive affect whenever they try to stop2. The experience of flow as positive affect would be even more welcome in these conditions, as those experiencing them would have less external and differential sources of pleasure. Further researcher can look at exciting possibilities in isolating individual components, such as telepresence, which have promising contributions to identifying exact ingredients for the flow experience.</p></font></font>

<h2><b>Active Media: Video Games</b></h2>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">While passive browsing of social media may produce similar flow-like physiological states, more active and skillful media-induced activity may also create these experiences in other ways. Thin et. al. examined the presence of flow states while playing movement-controlled video games and found reports of a flow experience similar to that of athletes in players, specifically in the areas of challenge-skill balance and action-awareness merging5. As noted above, the manipulation in degree of difficulty of an activity may lead to an enhanced ‘skill’ in the player, allowing them to access these states with less practice and performance than in the actual game itself. Flow state in video games was also found to occur more frequently when the level of skill matched the level of difficulty6, demonstrating that the matching of ability to challenge was more important than the objective competency of the player. </br>Finally, Soutter and Hitchens found a correlation between video game character relatability and the experience of flow, or that players were more likely to achieve a flow state when they were able to identify with their avatars7. All of these findings demonstrate a link between the idea of telepresence and flow state, and while video games may require more skill than social media browsing, the link to the player and the feeling of deep personal connection within the game is important for enhancing positive affect.<br></p>
