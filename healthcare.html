<p style="text-indent: 40px">Meeting these challenges requires collaboration among essential caregivers in treatment pathways, which is why many healthcare organizations are focusing on collaboration initiatives. Today, Cisco TelePresence for Healthcare can help you improve the business and clinical workflows that deliver the most powerful impacts – those that rely on people, information, and expertise.<br>
Cisco TelePresence creates immersive, in-person meeting experiences among geographically dispersed users – over the network. Integrated visual, audio and video components deliver the characteristics of a face-to-face meeting, creating a lifelike collaboration experience with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smooth and realistic motion</li>
<br>
<li>Accurate color replication</li>
<br>
<li>An apparent eye-to-eye viewpoint</li>
<br>
<li>Superb and accurate sound rendering, synchronized with the images presented</li>
<br>
<li>Hours of interaction without user fatigue</li>
<br>
<li>Life-sized user representation<li>
</ul>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">By enabling executives, physicians, specialists, patients, and suppliers to meet, discuss, and make decisions in real time, regardless of their locations, you can help them reduce the inefficiencies of traditional collaboration tools. Cisco TelePresence also reduces the need for frequent travel, enabling people to accomplish more in the same amount of time – without the stress and fatigue associated with travel. You gain the ability to effectively interact with virtual teams all over the world and manage these interactions in real time.</p><br>

<font size="4" color="black"><b>Enable Cost-effective Clinical Collaboration</b><br></font>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Cisco TelePresence can help you connect people across regional or global locations for training, consultation, and specialized collaboration. By creating an immersive experience for participants, Cisco TelePresence enhances training solutions. The experience facilitates learning and interaction, making it more effective for continuing medical education and resident training. Residents and staff no longer have to travel extensively for training, improving their clinical productivity, reducing travel-related fatigue, and minimizing travel expenses.</p>
<font size="4" color="black"><b>Extend Consultation Virtually</b><br></font>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Using Cisco TelePresence, you can extend consultation capabilities to sites won-location specialists. For institutions seeking to expand service coverage or provide remote care to affiliates and clinics, the ability to consult with patients remotely can be a significant advantage. The ability to provide remote care can also be a recruiting and retention benefit for physicians. In addition to direct caregivers, research teams and sales teams can benefit from enhanced collaboration capabilities as they develop new drugs, provide training on new instruments, or consult on innovative procedures.</p>
<font size="4" color="black"><b>Manage Distributed Operations</b><br></font>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Cisco TelePresence enables face-to-face meetings across global locations, such as administrative, nursing, and physician teams. Executives and specialty experts can collaborate “live” with internal teams, supply chain partners, and other resources, minimizing travel and its associated costs. The ability to collaborate in real time using Cisco TelePresence enables you to quickly deploy new clinical processes, manage remote sites more effectively, optimize clinical and staff resources, and participate in operations across multiple sites. The ability to immediately address issues and adapt to changing conditions helps improve care, optimize key clinical resources and broaden access to care. For many Cisco customers, a Cisco TelePresence solution pays back its investment within a year.</p>
<font size="4" color="black"><b>Scale Scarce Resources</b><br></font>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Limited physician and clinician resources can now be scaled across multiple locations to provide consistent, optimized levels of quality care. Specialized diagnoses and face-to-face consultations can be delivered cost-effectively and more frequently. Hospitals and specialty centers that are linked using Cisco TelePresence can take advantage of scarce resources, such as ICU physician monitoring, virtually. They can also cross-train teams faster, adopt new protocols more efficiently, and work together to deliver improved healthcare coverage to satellite and remote locations.</p>
