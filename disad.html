<h1 style="COLOR: #8A2BE2 ;"><left><b>Disadvantages of Online Collaboration</b1></left></h1>
</br> </br> </br>
<ol start = "1" >
<li>Lack of Face-To-Face Interaction</li>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">While online collaboration through video conferencing provides real-time communication between people, it lacks the aspect of face-to-face interaction. For instance, meeting participants cannot argue with one another simultaneously over the online platform because of longer lag times. That may sometimes limit the level of engagement of the employees in an online meeting. And when the quality of video stream is poor, it's difficult for meeting attendees to decipher facial expressions and body language of the presenter.</p>
<br><br>
<l1>Possibility of Network Failure and Equipment Breakdown</l1>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Online collaboration might provide a range convenient and efficient meeting options but network failure and equipment breakdown might limit its use. Participating in online collaboration meetings through video conference also requires the use of huge data bundles, which can be limiting to some attendees. Running out of data bundles leads to disconnection from the internet, which bars attendees from participating in collaborative efforts of finding solutions to a project. Meeting interruptions due to any of these reasons may cause a cross-collaboration team to work beyond the scheduled timelines in order to complete the project. That can delay project discussions and subsequently decision making, which might have significant cost implications.</p>
<br><br>
<li> Language and Cultural Differences</li>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The use of online collaboration software has made it easier for companies to bring together employees from different countries to collaborate in a given project. While that might be a good strategy to improve performance, differences in language and culture can limit the engagement of employees working in different regions. That means online collaboration cannot offer meaningful solutions in this case.</p>
<br><br>
<li>Incidences of Group Think</li>
<br>
</ol>		

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Bringing stakeholders from different departments and region to work together may undoubtedly inspire fresh perspectives on the project. However, there is always the threat of group think, where stronger personalities may take over the discussions, persuade and supplant the ideas of others. Such online collaborations might lead to the bosses believing the outcome is a group effort yet it's something that was agreed upon by a few. That might end up lowering the performance of a project as important ideas may be left out in the process.</p>

<br>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Beyond the comparison to traditional video conferencing, the basic telepresence concept presents some challenges in and of itself. When you do have two locations that always need to connect just to each other, each with a non-mobile compliment of staff, then telepresence is the clear answer for high quality, effective communications. But, what if you have three locations...or four?</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Telepresence systems have really struggled with these multipoint scenarios. One solution is called "voice switched" where a complex algorithm figures out who is speaking and makes sure that person is visible on one of the displays at each location. Another solution is "continuous presence" where everyone at each participating site is visible on the displays (in a smaller image) at all times. While both of these solutions allow for multipoint meetings, it really isn't telepresence anymore. In the first scenario you have to sacrifice the eye contact with those that aren't speaking - which frankly is sometime more important that looking at who is speaking. In the second scenario, you've sacrificed life-sized images, directional audio and all of the other things meant to differentiate the experience. In this frequent real world application the whole reason a firm has invested heavily in a telepresence system is gone. Also gone is telepresence favourable contrast with legacy video conference systems which can do the very same job with a rapid return on a much lower investment.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Human behaviour around the everyday use of telepresence systems also needs to be considered when choosing the right application environment. A smaller company with few locations represents an ideal usage. However, in a typical Fortune 500 firm you're likely working in a very large, multiple story building. Experience shows that it is very difficult to get users to leave their floor to access everyday meeting room spaces. Meeting rooms are requested to be no further than down the hall so that required attendance during a busy work day is not too difficult to achieve. If your firm has invested in a telepresence room, will your high level decision makers actually leave their floor (and possibly leave their building to go across a campus) to use it regularly? Is it that much better than the 50" flat screen and video conference system they may already have a few feet away? This could be true for very high level meetings involving critical decisions, but probably is not true for everyday meetings where nearby traditional video conferencing would suffice. On this subject, it is also important to keep in mind that if even one scheduled participant in a telepresence meeting chooses to remotely connect from his local room (assuming you are one of the lucky people that bought a telepresence system that is interoperable with traditional systems), you hit the same problem mentioned above, no life-sized images, no directional audio, again it really isn't telepresence anymore.</p>
